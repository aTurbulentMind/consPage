		during a Satanic Ritual. Okay that's bullshit, he was born in a hospital, but that shit would
		have been awesome if it was true.

		The Dark Minister has been infecting the world with his Horrorcrunk flows for the over 10 years
		now along side his partner in crime Bloodshot, and has 5 solid albums under his belt which
		include "I HATE COPS" and "Blasphemer".
